Purpose:
   IPC layer that implements rpmsg communication between cores.

Description:

This repository is the home for the Open Asymmetric Multi Processing (OpenAMP)
framework project. The OpenAMP framework provides software components that
enable development of software applications for Asymmetric Multiprocessing
(AMP) systems. The framework provides the following key capabilities.

* Provides Life Cycle Management, and Inter Processor Communication capabilities
  for management of remote compute resources and their associated software
  contexts.
* Provides a stand alone library usable with RTOS and Baremetal software
  environments
* Compatibility with upstream Linux remoteproc and rpmsg components
* Following AMP configurations supported:
  a. Linux master/Generic(Baremetal) remote
  b. Generic(Baremetal) master/Linux remote
* Proxy infrastructure and supplied demos showcase ability of proxy on master
  to handle printf, scanf, open, close, read, write calls from Bare metal
  based remote contexts.

Dependencies:
   libmetal (https://github.com/OpenAMP/libmetal) - provides HAL layer
   between OpenAMP and RTOS or OS environment.
