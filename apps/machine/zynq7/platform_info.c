/**
 * This array provdes defnition of CPU nodes for master and remote
 * context. It contains two nodes beacuse the same file is intended
 * to use with both master and remote configurations. On zynq platform
 * only one node defintion is required for master/remote as there
 * are only two cores present in the platform.
 *
 * Only platform specific info is populated here. Rest of information
 * is obtained during resource table parsing.The platform specific
 * information includes;
 *
 * -CPU ID
 * -Shared Memory
 * -Interrupts
 * -Channel info.
 *
 * Although the channel info is not platform specific information
 * but it is conveneient to keep it in HIL so that user can easily
 * provide it without modifying the generic part.
 *
 * It is good idea to define hil_proc structure with platform
 * specific fields populated as this can be easily copied to hil_proc
 * structure passed as parameter in platform_get_processor_info. The
 * other option is to populate the required structures individually
 * and copy them one by one to hil_proc structure in platform_get_processor_info
 * function. The first option is adopted here.
 *
 *
 * 1) First node in the array is intended for the remote contexts and it
 *    defines Master CPU ID, shared memory, interrupts info, number of channels
 *    and there names. This node defines only one channel
 *   "rpmsg-openamp-demo-channel".
 *
 * 2)Second node is required by the master and it defines remote CPU ID,
 *   shared memory and interrupts info. In general no channel info is required by the
 *   Master node, however in baremetal master and linux remote case the linux
 *   rpmsg bus driver behaves as master so the rpmsg driver on linux side still needs
 *   channel info. This information is not required by the masters for baremetal
 *   remotes.
